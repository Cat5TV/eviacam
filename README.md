Install eViacam on a modern Linux machine

## Description
eViacam allows you to control your Linux computer with face tracking. Your face movement is able to control your mouse cursor, reducing strain from RSI, or providing a reasonably useful accessibility feature to users who are able to move their head with precision (ie., shakiness would affect the usefulness of this process).

## Reasoning
I suffer from Ulnar Nerve Entrapment. A very painful RSI that comes and goes when I work myself too hard at my desk. Usually there are signs of it coming on that warn me to take a rest, but recently, while working on a customer deadline, I ignored these signs and have been regretting it for weeks as I suffer with the worst relapse I've had in several years. I remembered [demoing eViacam on Category5 Technology TV way back in 2012] (https://category5.tv/shows/technology/episode/259/), so I set out to install it via the traditional means on my shiny modern Linux Mint 19 box. But it didn't work. So, I set out to get it working, and decided to make it easier for the next person by creating an easy installer script.

## Thanks
Much of how this works was learned by reading through this issue thread: https://github.com/cmauri/eviacam/issues/14
